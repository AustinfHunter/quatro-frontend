# Quatro
Quatro is a nutrition app that allows users to track their nutrition, weight goals, and daily consumption habits with ease. It can be tough to keep track of daily consumption while also planning meals and making time for exercise.
Quatro is designed to make it easy. QuatBot, the Quatro Chatbo, can help you plan meals, make shopping lists, and analyze your eating habits - all according to your personal goals and preferences. 

## Features
### Food Journaling
The quatro journal helps you monitor your daily eating habits. The user dashboard features informative data visualizations that let you track your daily caloric intake and macros at a glance.

### Data Driven Approach
Quatro allows you, the user, to keep track of many things, such as your daily food intake, physical activity, dietary restrictions, and culinary preferences.
This data is then used to create a tailored experience for users - your health and fitness journey is unique and personal, the tools you use to help you along that journey should be too.

### QuatBot (The Quatro Chatbot)
QuatBot uses your food preferences, eating habits, goals, and dietary restrictions to make meal planning easy. You can plan for a whole week, or just ask for a good recipe for dinner. QuatBot helps you stay on track without the need to obsess about what you're going to cook next.

QuatBot uses a familiar interface, allowing users to jump right in and make use of all the its features.
